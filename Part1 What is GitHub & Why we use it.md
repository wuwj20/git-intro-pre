## Part1 What is GitHub & Why we use it

To understand exactly what GitHub is, we need to know two connected principles : **version control** and **Git**

### What is version control?

Version control is a system that helps to track and manage changes made to a file or a set of files. It helps developers track and manage changes to a software project’s code. All of these changes are then tracked and can be reverted if need be. To summarize, version control takes away the risks and the fear of making too many mistakes. Instead, it provides the freedom to collaborate and develop without too much worry.

### What is GIt?

Git is a specific open-source version control system created by Linus Torvalds in 2005.

Specifically, Git is a distributed version control system, which means that the entire codebase and history is available on every developer’s computer, which allows for easy branching and merging.

According to a Stack Overflow developer survey, over 87% of developers use Git.

### So what is GitHub then?

In short, GitHub is a cloud-based service that hosts a version control system (VCS) called Git. It allows developers to collaborate and make changes to shared projects while keeping detailed track of their progress.

### Popularity of GitHub

GitHub hosts over 100 million repositories, the majority of which are open-source projects.

### Why is GitHub so popular?

+ **Open-source**

  All GitHub users can track and manage changes being made to the source code in real-time while having access to all of the other Git functions available to them at the same place.

+ **User-friendly**

  GitHub’s interface is user-friendly enough so even novice coders can take advantage of Git. 

  Additionally, anyone can sign up and host a public code repository for free, which makes GitHub especially popular with open-source projects.

+ **Made for cooperation**

+ **Free**

  Additionally, anyone can sign up and host a public code repository for free, 	which makes GitHub especially popular with open-source projects.

### GitHub isn't just for developers

All this talk about how GitHub is ideal for programmers may have you believing that they are the only ones who will find it useful. Although it’s a lot less common, you can actually use GitHub for any types of files. If you have a team that is constantly making changes to a word document, for example, you could use GitHub as your version control system or to write a book. It even can become a source for learning ~~or maybe be used for a group presentation~~. The possibilities for its usage were almost **limitless**.
