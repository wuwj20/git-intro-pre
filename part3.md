## Advanced usage of Git

You have just learned the very basics of git. Now you may wonder, "Git does not differ a lot from a normal netdisk, like the Tsinghua netdisk, or Baidu (except for the speed of course)..." The following operations will be way better than those netdisks. 

The first one is the version control. When you make a commit, the git system automatically stores the current state of your repo. Then when you look back afterwards, it will be very easy for you to compare and find the differences of these commits. Like in Github, you can click the "commits" button, then select a commit you made before. You will see the changes you made at that commit, or you can browse the repo at that moment. Therefore, if you accidentally deleted some important files, or wrote some bugs in your program, you can restored the currect file. And you can say goodbye to your hand-written "Final version", "Final-Final version", etc.

Besides that, if you have many different ideas, but are unsure which one is better, you can use "branches". You can ... to create a new branch, and implement your idea in each branch seperately. In the end, when you have decided which one is better, you can set the "main" branch to it (like this), or you can merge some of the branches to absorb theirs advantages (like this).

Another, and one of the most function of git is the team collaboration. The core concept of it is the "distribution". Typically, each collaborater of the team will have a copy of the project (in his own repo), and do his contribution in his own repo. Then submit these changes to the team leader (make a pull request) and receive other's changes (a pr. from different direction). In Github, these actions are not hard: find a project you want to join in, click the "fork" button, then the whole repo will be copied to your account. Then you just do the changes in your own repo. When you are finished, make a pull request, and wait for its original manager to review your pr and accept it or further discussion.
